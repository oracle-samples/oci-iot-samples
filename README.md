# Oracle Internet of Things Platform Samples

This repository provides examples demonstrating how to use the Oracle Internet of Things
Platform.

## Setup

The examples and tutorials in this repository assume you have already provisioned an IoT
Domain Group and an IoT Domain.

## Sending Messages to the OCI IoT Platform Using a GUI

The samples below show you how to send messages from the command line or using programming
languages.  
If you want to send test messages using a GUI, you can use any MQTT-compliant client,
such as the following (Oracle has no preference or affiliation with any of these products):

- [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/)
- [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/)
- ...

**Note:** The OCI IoT Platform is _not_ an MQTT broker; you will not be able to listen
for messages from your devices.

Similarly, to test the REST APIs (for example, sending telemetry or querying telemetry
via ORDS endpoints), you can use:

- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- ...

## Viewing Telemetry

There are several options to view telemetry:

- The APEX IoT dashboard (see below): this is the easiest way to get an overview of your
  telemetry data.
- The APEX SQL Workshop to browse the database.
- Connect directly to the database with
  [SQLcl](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/sqlcl/) or
  [SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/) (see below).
- Query the database using the ORDS endpoints (see below).

## IoT Platform Explorer

Sample [APEX application](./apex/dashboard) that allows you to browse your IoT devices
as well as the messages received.

## How To
